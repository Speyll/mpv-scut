## Usage Guidelines

1. Make sure you have [mpv](https://mpv.io/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed on your system.
2. Download the `mpv-scut.lua` script and save it in your `scripts` directory. You can locate the `scripts` directory by running `mpv --list-scripts` or make it yourself.
3. Open a video using `mpv`.
4. Use the following key bindings to control the script:
   - Press `c` to set the starting point of a segment.
   - Press `x` to set the ending point of the current segment.
   - Press `s` to save the segments to a text file.
   - Press `z` to process and merge segments.
   - Press `r` to retry processing using saved segment points from txt file.

5. The merged video, without reencoding, will be saved as `merged_video.mp4` in the original video's directory.

**Please Note:** This script relies on the `osd_message` function in mpv, so ensure OSD messages are enabled in your mpv settings.
